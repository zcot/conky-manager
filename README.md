# Conky Manager 2 - a newer conky config manager

This is a fork of the old original Conky Manager by teejee2008(Tony George).

This latest version supports Ubuntu 16/17/18 versions as well as Mint 18 and 19 and likely equally any other newer Ubuntu derivative where Conky Manager had been previously in use.

It also provides support for the newer lua-based conky and configuration files(v1.10)
